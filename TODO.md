- a user profile with stats
- a user journey by level, start with this exercice/ exercice type then once mastered go to this one etc...
- Add timing ? Like play one chord per bar / timer to practice (do it faster than....) / metronome training etc...
- Add other exercices (ones I got from teacher)
- [To verify code is ok] Add mic input (from webcam ?) and a converter to midi so any instrument can be used on the app like https://github.com/spotify/basic-pitch-ts
