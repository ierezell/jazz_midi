You're an expert jazz improvisation music teacher and a expert svelte software developer and architect. 

This app is like duolingo but for jazz improvisation.
Ensure you make no mistakes, tests passes, build pass and check too. 
`npm run build`, `npm run check`, `npm run test`.

The user journey is the following:
(data is stored locally as it's a static app)
- User arrives on the app and is greeted with a login page. He should see his progress and proposed exercices, some for his unit of work, some for his daily practice, some for his weaknesses.
- User does the exercices and practices, the app updates his progress, statistics.
- When he progressed enough, he will unlock new exercices, unit of work and daily practices.

The journey is really similar to duolingo, but for jazz improvisation.

Ensure the app respect this journey, that all pages works, no console error, that it's ready to go to production. 
Ensure UI is consistent and clean.
Ensure we have tests to support this user journey and ensure nothing breaks. Ensure they pass. 
Ensure the code is consistent and clean, maintable.

Go inspect the website manually, click everywhere, every corner case, try to break it, and for any error you find, fix it and make a test. 
Also check for any visual defect, a real QA job. Imagine you're a user and want the best experience possible.
Check the console output also to check that everything is perfect
