In Journey page : 
- when scrolling the text goes in the nav bar
- The practice random exercice from this level does not take a random exercice from this level.

In the Gym page : 
- Exercices should have a more descriptive help / tooltip like : "Instead of Struggling? Musical notation will appear after 1 more mistake." Write something like : "Play a [Exercice goal here] after 3 mistakes the score/notation will appear."
- The UI is not beautiful or appealing. It's all black text on white background.

Overall : 
- There is still white text / white icons on white background.
- Dark mode button change NOTHING
- It's getting there but still not professional, fun or appealing.
