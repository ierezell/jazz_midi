## ðŸ“‹ Roadmap

- Add timer to practice (do it faster than....).
- Add a metronome training.
- Add metronome acceleration training
- Add rootless chords.
- Partition note reading exercices
- Add other exercices (ones I got from teacher)
- Add a MIDI file reader so it shows the notes ?
- Debug is not the same on chord pages.
- Random should have the same UI as each specific page
- Color should be red when hitting a wrong note
- Stats should be per note / scale
